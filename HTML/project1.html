    <p>Guwati is a land where colours, the desert, forts, camels, traditional food and folk music conspire to make a traveller its own. The only factor that might be holding people back from visiting it is the hot climate which is not a problem in January and other winter months. Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan, has been a hub of tourism for the last so many years; and why not? Very few cities in Indian can match the Pink City for its sheer opulence and rich heritage.</p>
